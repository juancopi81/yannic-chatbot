So apparently later, the ownership was transferred back and someone that we can assume that is from stability called cyberbullying said the ownership has been transferred to you following the post on Reddit, since it was a big issue for you, you can now do the transfer to a mad yourself and also a message from this scored itself saying yes, indeed, there was a mix up and they should have come to this person and ask them whether they really wanted to transfer the discord and not just take it away from them. So it's kind of unclear whether discord themselves found that they've screwed up and then the cyberbully person just kind of reacted to that because it just says has been transferred to you, or whether they've actually initiated it. To be honest, this also is it is like a bit passive aggressive. It's not like we're sorry, we clearly screwed up. So we're like, well, since you made a Reddit post, and you know, since this is a big issue, it's actually a small issue. But since to you, you know, you make a big deal out of it fine diva, right? You cannot transfer it yourself. It's very much the attitude of like, Oh, come on, it's not such a big deal. Like it kind of is a big deal. There's two levels here, right? Level one screw up happened probably by discord. Okay, we can we get it right? Like this stuff happens. But level two is sort\"}"

              "[\"On the Measure of Intelligence by François Chollet - Part 1: Foundations (Paper Explained): Hello there, today we're going to look at On the Measure of Intelligence by Francois Chollet of Google. This is a bit of a special episode I would say because if you look at the paper it is first of all is very long and then second of all it is a wall of text basically. Now it's very interesting text but if I were to go through this with you we'd basically just be kind of scrolling and reading along. So what I've done is I've basically read this and taken notes and I will attempt to just tell you what happens at least for the first part. So I intend for this to be a multi-part series because it's so long. So the first part as you can see here is context and history which is a little less boring than it sounds. The second part is going to be a new perspective where Chollet proposes his measure of intelligence and the third part is going to be about the benchmark, the Arc benchmark that is currently I believe running on Kaggle. So as it sees, as it looks right now, three parts and today we're going to dive into that first part. So here we go. He basically says that we need to define what intelligence means. We need an explicit goal to measure where if we think about AI like artificial intelligence, what does intelligence mean? We need something where we can basically put a number or multiple numbers on it and says that's intelligence, that's not intelligent. What we have right now is just basically anecdotes. It's just we all kind of feel what seems intelligent but we are not like sure and sometimes it's very misleading. He brings up the Turing test for example which is that you have a computer or a human behind a wall and on the other end sits a human and the human needs to kind of communicate without seeing what he communi or what he or she communicates with and then determine whether or not on the other side of the wall is a human or a computer and if the computer could fool a human into kind of a 50-50 guess then the computer would be passing the Turing test and therefore intelligent. Now, Chollet doesn't go right now into why that's not sufficient but he's basically saying this is not sufficient it's distracting and second of all it's basically just outsourcing the problems of defining intelligence to human right to this human right here who is fallible and noisy and you know doesn't all doesn't really know all you all you tell the human is basically like is this thing intelligent does this thing seem human to you it's also not clearly defined so we need some something more and Chollet says the definitions that exist today of intelligence are basically they they have implicit they are implicit definitions that are loaded with biases and biases\",\n",
              " \"On the Measure of Intelligence by François Chollet - Part 1: Foundations (Paper Explained): basically from a human perspective on what intelligence is and if we want to really make progress in terms of measuring intelligence we need to point out these biases that are in these measures okay they has a range of quotes namely one here intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments that was I believe the conclusion of a an author that distilled lots of different definitions and try to distill them into one one sentence and that's it intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments so the crucial parts here is to ability to achieve goals so it must the agent must be you know doing something useful doing it like in reinforcement learning we'd say it must be getting higher rewards and the second part is in a wide range of environments so the the notion right here that we're going to encounter time and time again is basically an addition of skill and adaptivity so if you have it's not enough to have high skill you also need to be kind of adaptive to very very different environments to a range of environments and that's this this is the main issue that show lay has with the current sort of definitions of intelligence and the current direction of the AI field because it mostly measures skill and not generalization or adaptivity now he he says in this thing in this sentence right here that you just saw there is an implicit sort of something is said implicitly namely that these these these skills this ability to achieve goals in this wide range of environments it must be acquired it must be learned these these new tasks these different environments the agent should basically learn to adapt to the different environments then and then the agent is intelligent it's not that intelligent when it is sort of pre-programmed to already handle these environments so he says that's that's sort of implicit in that statement and we're going to see how this is made explicit later he goes into basically there are two two different viewpoints on intelligence this old nature versus nurture debate and that refers to two things like crystallized intelligence versus skill acquisition intelligence so the evolutionary view would be that intelligence is sort of this set of static programs and here we simply kind of boil down these two views to their extremes right so don't I don't think any major evolutionary biologist is complete like is apps is that extreme right now but these were historical set of views that were held one of them was that intelligence is basically just it's all pre-programmed into you by evolution so you can you can solve this puzzle because during evolution you know your ancestors that could solve these puzzles were were survived you can plan your path through a tree jungle because you know that was beneficiary to you and so\",\n",
              " \"On the Measure of Intelligence by François Chollet - Part 1: Foundations (Paper Explained): evolution put that into your brain and therefore what results is AI is the science of making machines capable of performing tasks that would require intelligence if done by humans that's basically what Minsky said the quote I believe by Minsky at least show they says it's by Minsky or I misread where if you have this this set of view that that AI is basically just this set of static programs that means that if a human applies that set of programs to a task right and the human achieves 200 points it means if the if an AI comes along and achieves 201 points then it is intelligent because it has simply the better set of the better it has outperformed the static set of programs intelligence is this static set of programs and the AI has a better set of static set of programs so it's basically Minsky says if we know of a task that would require intelligence if done by a human then if something that can solve that task is intelligent and this equates learning basically just to memorization if you if you ask a proponent of this viewpoint well what's what's learning like if everything is pre-programmed what we can still learn and they would say yeah but the learning is just you memorize situations and that particular ability is also pre-programmed into you the other extreme viewpoint is this table or also viewpoint where it basically says you come into this world and your brain is a blank slate and everything you all of your abilities you basically must acquire through learning throughout your life so this is another extreme viewpoint and in terms of intelligence where that leads is following AI is the science and engineering of making machines do tasks they have never seen and have not been prepared for beforehand and that's a quote by McCarthy and Friedberg if we're ever to make a machine that will speak understand translate human languages solve mathematical problems with imagination practice a profession or direct an organization either we must reduce these activities to a science so exact that we can tell a machine precisely how to go about doing them or we must develop a machine that can do things without being told precisely how so this leads to more of of these notions right here that you can see here how the machines have not been prepared for a particular situation so if we make a machine that can do a task that it has not been prepared for we we know it's basically intelligent and again so if we make a machine that can do all of these things all of the things right here then either Friedberg says we must reduce these activities to assign so basically we must program the solution in there already or we must develop a machine that can do things without being told precisely how and as you as you might realize this\",\n",
              " \"On the Measure of Intelligence by François Chollet - Part 1: Foundations (Paper Explained): is much closer to the to the machine learning paradigm it's basically it's all about how much you say precisely because the extreme proponent of this thing would would basically recognize any sort of learning anything that you haven't seen before is an intelligent right if you if you can handle any new situation you're intelligent and surely is going to argue that that's also not really the case like we have to be a bit more graded about it but this is basically the machine learning approach it's it's we build machines that can do things without being told precisely how that they have not been prepared for beforehand like it can solve things that are not in the training data that's one interpretation and if you're a very strong proponent of this you would call that intelligent and so they're gonna argue that the truth of course is somewhere in the middle between these two viewpoints and therefore defining intelligence in either of these terms is going to lack in in expressivity and in usefulness so how do we evaluate AI and show they goes through different levels here of AI evaluation so first of all he contrasts these these two things right here skill based evaluation and generalization based evaluation so in skill based evaluation you basically go for one given task so you evaluate a system on one given task one example here is for example the Turing test and that's done by human review another example is where you have like a proof so you evaluate a system in by giving its optimality proof you can analyze it and you can say it is always correct at this particular task what you can also do is this peer competition so this is maybe what we see in sort of like chess so we let the bots play first humans and then we let them play other bots and we determine which one's the best and also the most familiar one benchmarks so this would be where your I don't know your image net net test set is right that's right here that's a skill based evaluation that's one given task how well can you solve the image net test set without looking at it that's one task so the problem show they says with these this skill based evaluation is sort of obvious it's like a single focus you can't like you are only good at this particular thing and that is one of the examples of this is the fact that the Kaggle models are usually the winning Kaggle models are usually useless outside of that particular data set because they're just so hyper optimized and hyper focused on winning that particular Kaggle competition so it's actually it's actually a pretty strong science on how to set up a Kaggle competition such that you can then use the model the winning model afterwards for doing something actually useful no there are no conditions on\",\n",
              " \"On the Measure of Intelligence by François Chollet - Part 1: Foundations (Paper Explained): how to arrive at a solution and there surely lets a bit of that that's basically his point that's gonna come in to the the measurement later into the math where he says you simply have to arrive at a solution in this skill based evaluation it the skill based evaluation usually doesn't care how you arrive there so the image net test set score doesn't care how you got the neural network or what not that you got it simply cares how many images do you classify correctly and this leads to what is called the AI effect which I didn't know it was called like this until recently but it's fairly obvious where people say people say people come up with a task that's that is intelligence so people used to say oh checkers the game of checkers it requires intelligence and then you build a machine to solve checkers because you can just I don't know search do like a bit of a smart tree search and you solve it and you tell them here's like a tree search that does checkers and they'll say well but that's not that's not really intelligent it's just like a tree search but but chess chess you can't possibly do the treat the full tree search so chess is intelligent and the then you build like a smarter tree search they build the stock fish and they're like yeah but that's just you know that's just this machine thing and so the goalposts keep moving every time they come up with a task and you solve the tasks they'll just say wow that's not really intelligence this next task that's intelligence and it's easy to see that if you just do this skill based evaluation you will never get there because it's always going to be on the next task the next task the next task it's overly anthropocentric it's overly based on how humans view the world and what is not left in here and again this this acquisition what is not in this definition is the fact that why do we think that someone that plays chess very well like why do we think Magnus Carlsen is smart why do we think someone like a go master is very intelligent and that's because we know that this person is human at least we believe there are doubts about these some of these grandmasters but we believe that they are humans and therefore we know that they have only had whatever 20 30 years to learn this and they must eat regularly and they can only think so fast and it's it's hard to memorize things as a human so we know all of their constraints that went into learning this and we we basically know there is it's not like we are not aware of something like neo has in the matrix where you can just upload the solution to chess into your brain we know what's required\",\n",

It walks from one checkpoint to another checkpoint, and then to the next checkpoint, and so on. And that is its task, it gets reward from walking from checkpoint to checkpoint. Take a look at this. And this is called the end. It also walks from checkpoint to checkpoint. Now we've seen a lot of reinforcement learning algorithms in this environment is called Muko Joe, where you basically teach these little things to walk around. So the what's the impressive part here, the impressive part is that at training time, this and has never ever seen what a checkpoint is, and has never gotten any reward from walking from checkpoint to another checkpoint. Actually, it has never gotten any reward for anything that that is given from the environment, it has discovered the skill of walking by itself. And then at test time, there is no additional learning when it goes from checkpoint to checkpoint, it simply composes the skills that it knows from its unsupervised discovery phase in order to go from checkpoint to checkpoint. So here you can see, this paper basically proposes to learn these skills in a completely unsupervised way at the beginning sort of so in the training phase, it learns these skills, you can see these skills that the humanoid has learned. And then all you have to do at test time is to compose these skills to reach a given goal. And these are the things that the end has learned. Watch out, this is trippy. You can see it has learned various walks various ways walking here. And if you know anything about this environment, it's actually not that easy to make the ant walk by itself. So the the discovery here that these skills that are discovered are various ways of walking is actually already pretty impressive. And the last thing here, this cheetah, of course, also has to has learned to walk back forward kind of jump around and so on. So we're going to dive into this paper. It's called dynamics aware unsupervised discovery of skills by Archie Sharma and other people of Google brain. So this was published at iClear 2020. And on a high level, I already said it's basically proposing to learn unsupervised skills, and then to compose these skills in a model based planning method at test time to reach a given goal without additional training without additional training on the reward that you give at test time. As always, if you like videos like this, you're very welcome to subscribe and share it to everyone you know. Yeah. Okay, let's dive in. So they say, conventionally model based reinforcement learning aims to learn a global model for the dynamics of the environment, which is not exactly true, right? So we have we dive into model based and model free reinforcement learning. Model based reinforcement learning basically means that you have a model of the\",\n",
              " \"Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills (Paper Explained): environment. A example for this is, let's say, tic tac toe. So in tic tac toe, I know, I have nine actions at my disposal. And if I take action, let's say I take action zero, which is to make a let's say I'm the X player. So I take action zero. And if I you know, number my things correctly, then that will result in this state of the world. Okay, so I know exactly how the world will look when I take a given action. And what that allows me to do is that allows me to actually plan. So I cannot plan ahead, I can say what would happen if I took action zero, so I can do this in my mind. And then what would happen if I took action one, I can be like, okay, that's gonna happen. And I can do this with many things. And I can in my mind, continue this and basically roll out the entire games, or and then only do the given action that has led to the best result at the end, right. So this is model model based reinforcement learning means you have a model of the environment, you know what's going to happen when you perform given actions. And you can also combine this with machine learning, like, you know, alpha, alpha go alpha zero or so they have models of the games they're playing, they know what's going to happen. But it's very intractable to basically go down this entire tree and plan out everything. So they combine it with machine learning. It doesn't change that it's a model based. Now in, in opposition to that in model free in in reinforcement learning, what you do, you are these agent, the heirs of the environment, and you simply have to do an action, I do action zero, and the environment just gives you back a reward and the next observation. And it you have basically no clue how the environment will change. If you do something, you all these and all these, these agents do or the classic model free agents do is basically they're trying to have a neural network somewhere in them. And you put the observation in here and outcomes and action. And you can do this in various ways into Q learning or policy gradient or actor critic, and so on. But ultimately, it's simply mapping the optic current observation, and maybe the last few to the best action to take without explicitly modeling what happens in the environment. Now, when they say model based reinforcement learning, what they mean is technically, what you can do, if you're in if you are in the model free, if you're in this situation, what you could do is you could say, Well, since these model based RL techniques tend to work better, I could hear inside the agent, I could try to learn a model of the environment, E prime, and I could\",\n",
              " \"Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills (Paper Explained): try to basically learn what happens in my environment when I do a certain action. And then I could use that model right here, in order to do this planning that I know from up here, okay. So in this case, they go for exactly this they go for, let's learn a model of the environment, this is not an exact model, it's a learned model. And then let's use that to plan. Now, this usually has a bunch of, you know, very, a bunch of things that go against it, namely, if this model right here is bad, then the planning in the model will often accumulate and even exaggerate the errors that are in this model. So it's sometimes very hard to learn a model of the world and then use that for planning. And I've recently done a paper where where curious AI takes denoising auto encoders to regularize exactly such a planning procedure to counter this. And this paper right here is a different approach of combining this learned model. This learned model. So, okay, that was about the first sentence. They say it aims to learn a global model for the dynamics of the environment. A good model can potentially enable planning algorithms to generate a large variety of behaviors and solve diverse tasks, which is true, right? If I have a model of the environment, then I could just use it to plan, I wouldn't even have to do anything fancy anymore, right? If I have a model of how my tic-tac-toe works, I can just plan, plan my way to success. And I can do this alpha zero style. Or if the, if this state tree is small enough, I can actually just use a planner. And I don't even have to, I don't have to do anything anymore. If I have a good model, they say however, learning an accurate model for complex dynamical systems is difficult. And even then the model might not generalize well outside the distribution of states on which it was trained. So this is another problem. If you learn a model, it's only going to be valid in a certain range. Okay. And say in this work, we combine model based learning with model free learning of and the model free learning is of primitives that make model based planning easy. So what they attempt to do is they attempt in an unsupervised fashion to learn so called set of skills. And the set of skills could be something like walk forward, walk backward, stay put, jump. So they attempt to learn things like this in a model free way, that the model is simply asked to come up with these things or the agent is simply asked task to come up with these things. And then in in stage two, a planner can use these skills and decompose a plan. Now this plan here, the special thing about this plan, this planner, it doesn't operate in\",\n",
              " \"Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills (Paper Explained): the space of actions of like small scale actions, it actually operates in the space of these skills right here. So here would be walk forward, walk back. So and with if we have a good enough model of the environment, then will tell us if I walk forward in this situation, what will happen? Okay, so I can walk forward and then after that I could walk backward, what's going to happen? And if I have a good model of the environment over the and the actions now are these macro actions of these skills, then I can use planning to reach my goal. Okay, so the question is, how do we come up with useful skills that the planner can then use? So they need to be somewhat diverse, right? But also, and here is the crucial part and the the sort of contribution of this paper, they say, how can we discover skills, whose outcomes are easy to predict? And this is how they counteract this notion here, that if your environment model is crap, then you're you're, it can't basically can't be used for planning, you'll just make it worse. So what they say is that these things right here, these skills that we learn, we will learn them in a way that make them easy to predict. So it makes it easy to predict what will happen after I do them. So they must be at the same time diverse. So only, you know, if you stay put, it's pretty easy to predict what's going to happen like nothing. Okay, but we're going to see in the exact objective that they have to be sort of diverse. But also, so only one of them can be stay put, the other ones have to do something else. But also, they should be easily predictable by the environment model. And if you learn the skills such that they're easily predictable, your environment model will make less errors, and then you can use it for planning. Okay, let's dive in. They do actually open source code, and they have more of these videos, if you want to check it out, I'll link everything in the description. Okay, let's actually dive into the the meat right here. They say they do maximize the mutual information. And we're going to see between between what and what they want to maximize the mutual information. If you don't know what the mutual information is, the mutual information is a quantity. The mutual information between x and y is a quantity, that's the entropy of x minus the entropy of x conditioned on y, or you can also decompose it in the other way around entropy of y minus entropy of y conditioned on x. And we're going to they apply this, where is it equation two right here. Okay, so what they want is the following, they want to maximize the mutual information. And the mutual information basically means how much does\",\n",
              " \"Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills (Paper Explained): one variable tell me about the other variable, okay. The mutual information between the skill and we're going to see what that is, and the next state. So what, what is a skill? A skill is one entry in our table right here. So these here are skills, skills, and they're in their index by z. Now z here, it seems like they're discrete, right? But in this case, they would be z would be a continuous vector. But it's easier if you imagine that. So each one of this is like z one, z two, and so on. They're going to be continuous, but in our case, we'll just think of a discrete set of skills to be learned. Okay, so they say we want to maximize the mutual information between the skill that's currently in action. So in every, every time, the agent has to like choose a skill and saying like, Okay, now I'm going to walk forward. And it's in a given state. And what you want to say is you have to maximize the mutual information between the skill and the next state, which means that it means two things, which you can see right here, you can decompose it in two different ways. One way is the following is to say, if I know which state I'm in, what's the entropy over my? Okay, that's a wrong bad way of formulating it. It's if I knew if I know these two things. So if I know the state I'm in, and the next state that I'm going to write, I can in hindsight, I look back, if I know both things, what can I say about this skill z right here, that I couldn't say just from the starting state. So the starting state, let's say is the person right here, and the end state is the person a little bit more over there. So let's let's call this forward, it's the person is looking to the right. Okay. Now, if I only show you if I only show you the state on the left, the starting state, what can you tell me which action is going to follow right here? Basically, you can't tell me much, it could be any action like walk forward, walk back, stay put. But if I also show you the next state, then you can pretty confidently say, Ah, I know what you did, you did walk forward. Okay, so this, in this situation, we would have a high mutual information between z and s prime in the formulation here, if you decompose it in the other way, it this is equivalent, but it's a different way of thinking about it, it means, when I show you these two things, how much more can you tell me about the next state than if I only show you this. So in this formulation, what we would do is, we would say, I tell you, the human is here looking\",\n",
              " \"Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills (Paper Explained): to the right, what can you tell me about the next state? And you like what I, I couldn't tell you very much, right? It can be anything. But if I then tell you the action is walk forward, then you could say, Ah, now I now I get it, it's probably going to be something like this. Okay, this also would be a high mutual information. So you see that the the task of maximizing this mutual information is good, because what happens if I don't, if I have a low mutual information, if I have a low mutual information, it would mean that I could predict the next state, just as well from the current state, it doesn't make a difference whether you give me the skill or not, it would not make a difference. And that is only the case if my skills are basically either all the same or all pretty, pretty random and pretty useless. Right. So if, if all my skills are basically walking backwards, then I don't, you don't have to tell me which skill you do, I'm gonna know that the next state is like this. So you can see that the objective of maximizing the mutual information between the skill and the next state is going to result in a situation where these skills are going to be first of all, diverse, and second of all, easy to easy to predict. Okay. And to see this, yeah, we only have to imagine what would happen, what would happen in a in a situation where the skills weren't diverse or weren't easy to predict. And you'll get exactly the situation where the information of the skill doesn't help you in predicting the next state, because yeah, either it's obvious or it's random. Okay, so we agree that it makes sense to maximize the mutual information. And they decompose this into two objectives. So they say the mutual information is basically what you'll have to do is you'll have to it decomposes into two terms where you can into two terms in a lower bound in the mutual information. And this is kind of the this is sort of the standard variational approximation literature. If you're into that read up on variational auto encoders and things like this. Basically, the two steps here are you tighten the variational lower bound and you maximize the approximate lower bound. Okay, so you have the mutual information and you can lower bound it. Okay, you can you can lower bound it by this quantity. Now the if since this is a lower bound, you can prove that this is a lower bound. It means that the higher you make this term, then the the more basically, okay, if it's a lower, I don't know how to formulate, but it should be fairly obvious if this if this thing on the right is a lower bound to the mutual information, then maximizing the thing on the right\",\n",
              " \"Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills (Paper Explained): will maximize the thing on the left. And it will do so. Very so imagine I is up here. And this E on the right side is down here. It's a lower bound, right? It's lower than I. So if I maximize E, well, I haven't really done anything to I but if I maximize it even more up to here, and since it's a lower bound, I know now my I must be at least higher than this. Okay, so maximizing a lower bound to a quantity will ultimately increase the quantity. But you can also the efficiency by which it does this depends on how tight the bound is. So if the bound is very tight, like this, you see I is not much above E. If the bound is very tight, then maximizing E will result in a faster maximization of I. Okay, so you can do two things. You can maximize the quantity that is the lower bound, or you can tighten the bound. And here we can see that the difference that the tightness of the bound depends on this quantity right here, which is the KL divergence between this and this. So yeah, let's watch this in the context of we can actually go go through it on the high level. If you've never done this variational approximation sort of math, then this might be a bit informative. Okay, so the thing right here is just pops out of the definition of the mutual information. It's the it's basically the differences of the entropies, which the entropies are log quantities, right. So if you have a log a minus log b, that you can also write this as the log of the fraction of a over b, that's just a property of the log. And so it's expectations over logs, these entropies. So you can write it as this thing right here. Okay. And this basically says, this is very high, if or very low, depending so you need to whether something is low or high always will depend on what you exactly you have to consider. But ultimately, what you'll want is the ratio between this quantity, which is the probability of the next state given the current state and the skill you're taking divided by just the probability over the next state, given the the current state in expectation over all the skills, current states and next states. Now what they're saying is this here, this is basically the environment, right? This is if you are in a state and you perform a skill, what's the next state? That's that's the true environment appear is the true environment, which we don't know, right? We don't know what the environment's going to do. But we would like to learn a model for the environment. And this model for the environment is now q, q theta, phi, theta, phi, Greek letter. So q phi here is going to be a neural network that will\",\n",
              " \"Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills (Paper Explained): approximate the environment. And in this probabilistic framework, it is going to be a learned distribution that will approximate the distribution of p. So we approximate it by this, but now this is here it says equal equal, right? This is not equal, because this is just an approximation. So the equality must become must be basically compensated for by this term, right here, you can see, this here is expanded into these two, you can go through the exact definitions and see why this is an equality. But basically, you can say that the mutual information is this expectation, or it is this expectation. But now you have to correct for the fact that here, you only have an approximation. And you have to correct for the fact by exactly the amount by which the approximation is different than the quantity that you're approximating. And this is this key KL divergence right here. So the KL divergence basically measures how different two distributions are. It's, it's sort of a distance, not exactly distance, but sort of a distance between these two distributions right here. It says, here's the real world. And here is your estimate of the real world, how much do they disagree. And that quantity plus, then you can replace your world, the exact world distribution by your approximate distribution, and you still are equal to the mutual information. And now the basically the trick is you say, oh, the KL divergence is always positive. It's a quantity that it can only be a positive number. So if I leave it away, certainly, this is only this is going to be a lower bound to the quantity. Okay. All right. So two tasks right here. First of all, tighten the variational bound, which means make this quantity small, make your approximate world model as close as possible to the real world. How do we do this neural network, okay, you input trajectories. I was in this state, I performed this skill, and I ended up in this state. Sorry, that's this. And then you simply match your neural network simply matches what happens in the real world, it learns the transition function, basically. So that's, that's the tightening of the variational bound. And the second step is this right here to to maximize the approximate lower bound, right, the first step was tighten variational low bound, that basically means make your world model more accurate. And the second is tighten that maximize the approximate lower bound. Now, this is going to part the this is going to be the part that says, now, given that I already have a better world model right here, can I improve my, can I sort of improve my skills, such that they become easier to predict and more diverse? Can I improve my skills such that this mutual information right here gets to be high as high as possible? Okay. So this is sort of an alternating thing. And you can\",\n",
              " \"Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills (Paper Explained): see this in this very, very, very, very confusing diagram, honestly. So what are you going to do in this algorithm? First of all, in each episode, you're going to select a skill at random. And as I said, these skills, they're not predefined. So no one tells the agent to walk for it simply says, Okay, you have like, in a discrete case, you would have like, you have five skill slots, right? And the only thing I require is that they're sort of, you know, consistent over time. So skill one is always going to be sort of the same thing and skill two, but agent, you can basically decide what skill one is, right? But make the skills such that it's predictable, and that the different skills are diverse. Okay, so you're going to sample one of the skills, like skill zero or whatnot. And then you're going to do two things. First of all, you're going to learn these skill dynamics, which is you're going to learn your approximate model of the world. Okay. And how do you do that? Basically, here, you're the agent, and the agent will. So what what does the agent have to do, the agent will take in the skill Z. And it will take in the current state of the world, and it will output an action. Now, this is the model free part, right? So the agent that somehow has to come up with saying, ah, skill zero, that's, that's, that's walking forward. And in this situation, walking forward means I have to lift my leg or something like this. So you're going to take your skill, you're going to with your agent perform an action based on that skill and the current state of the world, then the environment is going to give you the next state right here. And from those things, you can now learn your world model, you know, I was in state s, I, I performed action a, but I performed action a based on skill Z. And then I ended up in state s prime. And I can learn a model of the world, right? This is a triple, I can do supervised learning of a world model. Now here, they do probabilistic learning, but and we're going to see in a second how that works. But ultimately, they approximate the world with their model. Cool. So that's the this outer loop. And then what are they going to do next, they're going to use that world model to determine a reward for the agent, and the reward for the agent for taking the action. So the reward is going to be, oh, agent, you took action a. Now what's your reward for doing this? This is the model free reinforcement learning part, your reward is going to be very high, if if this was very predictable. And if it is also diverse, right, so now, the agent has to sort of map\",\n",
              " \"Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills (Paper Explained): sort of the agent has to go and make this quantity very high this, we want the outcome of these actions to be predictable, and dive and the actions themselves to be diverse. It is, I'm sorry, it's very hard to keep all of this very straight, okay. But ultimately, two steps, learn world model from the experience that you've generated. And second thing, learn the agent such that it maximizes this this quantity that we've seen before. And you do this via giving the agent a reward that is proportional to the mutual information. And we've already seen that we can approximate the mutual information by by this quantity here. Okay. So learn world model, and make the agent go higher mutual information, two steps. Okay, learn world model is very, very classic, you can say, okay, I need to improve, I need to minimize this KL divergence. So I need the gradient with respect to the parameters of my world model, I can write down the KL divergence like this. And then since I can do this reverse, so log a over b is log a minus log b. And since the world doesn't depend on the parameters of my model, this will simply give me this thing right here, which is the gradient of the log probability basically of my neural network. And this can be just optimized straightforward. This is a neural network optimized with gradient descent. These are the inputs, this is the output. Now, okay, you this is all probability distributions, but ultimately, you can you can do it pretty straightforward. Okay, so corresponds to maximizing the likelihood of the samples from P under q. Now, the second step, maximize the approximate lower bound, okay. So after they say after fitting q after improving our world model, we can optimize pi pi is the agent that actually takes the actions based on the skill. So it's given a skill, and it needs to perform an action. And it needs to maximize this quantity, as we've seen, needs to maximize the mutual information between if I know the action and if I don't, or the mutual information between the skill and the next state. I say note, this is a reinforcement learning style optimization, with a reward function of this quantity. However, so you look at the quantity that they need right here, the quantity is going to be this thing. And this thing is just I feed the skill and the state into my world model. And I look what what comes out of the world model. So this I can compute, right. But this thing right here, I can't compute because this is this is what happens in the world when I'm in state s, and I just run my agent over in expectation over all the skills. So this I don't know, they have a log of this is intractable. And they so we approximate the reward function for pi as this\",\n",
              " \"Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills (Paper Explained): thing right here. Now, first, let's look at what this thing is. So the reward of taking action a and action a is based on skill z, right? So skill z was fed into the agent, the agent comes up with action a. Oh, you want me to walk forward in this situation? Okay, I'm going to lift my leg. That's the action. Okay, so the reward for this action, given this skill, and given the current state is going to be what it's going to be very high, if this here is very high. So it's going to be very high, if the probability so this s prime is the state you ended up in, right? So after taking the action, you ended up in s prime. So if what does it mean, when this quantity is very high, it means that my world model q, that is approximating the world thinks that this state is very probable, if you were in this state, and are given the skill z. So this basically means that the neural network can predict with very high accuracy, what's going to happen if you are in this state and are given this skill to perform, right? This is one of the things that we want. Now, what is it divided by? It's divided by this. And you can see here, the zi are other skills. So it is, what does this mean? This is almost the same quantity, it means how well can the same neural network predict the next state, if you were given a different skill. So it means if I'm here, and I ended up here, how well can you predict it if I tell you that I walked forward? And here you ask, well, how well can you predict it if I also if I told you you walked backward, if I told you you jumped if I told you, and so on. So you basically aggregate over all the other over all the other skills you could perform. And each time you ask the neural network, well, how likely is it that you end up in the state that I ended up when? So what does it mean if this quantity is high, or sorry, if the entire sum here is high, that means that the skill doesn't really give you much information, the neural network is very good, no matter which skill you selected, right? It's very accurate in predicting the next state doesn't really matter. The skill doesn't really matter. And this is what we don't want, right? We want that the the skills are very diverse, right? So the top part is they're easy, it's easy to predict what will happen if you perform a given skill. And if we divide this by the bottom part, and this makes it such that these skills are very diverse, because if they're not diverse, then it doesn't really matter which one you perform. And then this quantity\",\n",
              " \"Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills (Paper Explained): on the bottom will be very high, but we divide by it. So we want, we want it to be low. Okay, that the reward is going to be the log of this fraction here. And this makes sense, right intuitively, but they're going to try to motivate this mathematically. And for motivating this mathematically, of course, they need to approximate this quantity right here. This quantity is the denominator. So they this denominator is a proc is an approximation to this, it's an approximation. As you can see here, this is sort of sort of a sample based approximation to the transition from s to s prime under the distribution of z. But what you want is just is the transition from s to s prime, not in your approximation, but in the real world. And they formulate this, they say, okay, we can decompose it as such as a as an integral over this conditional right here. So they bring in the z variable. And then they say, well, this, this is approximately approximately, we can replace this here by this. And we can replace this here by this, they say, well, since the this is a an approximation, the two, this is the world model is an approximation to the real world, we can sort of replace that. And then this is the this is the part that doesn't convince me they say, well, this p z of s, we can just replace it by p z. Now this is it's very tricky to see what these quantities are. Ultimately, it ends up being that right here. But it's it's it's so tricky. So they say, we replace p z given s by p of z. And, okay, let's think about this for a second. What does the top the bottom quantity is simply the distribution over your skills. And depending on your sample them, this could be like a uniform distribution over your skills, like that's fine. But what's the top thing? The top thing, basically, we can use base formula to reformulate it. It's p of s given z times p of right times p of z divided by p of s. So this quantity depends on multiple things. Here's that prior again. And this means what's the general distribution of states? What's the general distribution of states if your agent acts in the world, right? This and this we don't know. We don't we don't know. And also this right here. What's the distribution in the true world? What's the probability of a state given a given given that you were acting under a skill z. And this is also something we don't know because we don't know the world. We don't have the world model. So you run into the same problem again and again, that you're trying to approximate this and they want to make this so mathematically rigorous, but ultimately, and they go in the appendix, they go through various ways\",\n",
              " \"Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills (Paper Explained): that they could solve this. But ultimately, they're just to say, well, this is approximately the same. So this right here, it basically means what skills if you're if you're in a certain state, what skills brought you here, basically, what skills brought you here? What's the distribution of skills that brought you to this state? And they say, well, we're just going to approximate that by the prior distribution over our skills, we disregard the state here. And this seems overly shaky. Like, as I said, the entire paper makes sense. But I just feel it's trying to be overly mathematical, and then run into a point where you can't be and then they're just okay, we'll, we'll just replace it. And then sort of things break down, like, you can only be overly mathematical to some degree. It doesn't really fit. But okay, so this is how you discover the skills, you maximize these quantities, alternately, you learn the world model, and you improve your your skills by making them diverse and easily predictable. So how do you then plan using these skills? This is the second part of the paper. And this is just as complicated as the first part. So they say, given the learned skills, so the learned skills are policies over action given the DZ, right? So now you know how to like walk forward and walk back and so on. And now you're, you're placed in a world, and you're given this checkpoint, it says, well, walk there. And you want this to do this using planning, you don't want to learn anymore, you simply want to plan. Okay, what do you do? And as I said, this is even more. So what you want to do is you want to do something like model predictive control, but not over actions, but over your learned skills. So you have this planner in the NPC and the planner will in its head roll out a number of different a number of different plans, it will kind of explore a bunch of different different plans, Z, it will roll them out, I'll say, okay, if I do this, and this, and this, and this, what will happen using its world model that it has learned, it will observe what's going to be the reward in each of these cases. Now, they say here access the environment reward, but can also be estimated. And this is another sort of, I feel weak point of this in that they now assume they have the true reward function. But they don't have a world model, right? They don't have the world model, but they assume that they can sort of always ask for the true reward, which is probably not the case if you if you like if you had a true world, but it could be the case, the reward could be something like, well, if you're over there, you get higher reward, but you don't exactly\",\n",
              " \"Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills (Paper Explained): know how to get over there. In any case, so they roll out a bunch of trajectories in their head, they kind of plan forward, see what's going to happen if they do this or that or this or that. And then they choose the best one of these forward thoughts. And they execute it in the real world, right? So they say, Well, I'm going to you choose the skill walk forward. So the agent is now going to be tasked with walking forward. And it's going to do that in the real world for a certain amount of steps, like 10 steps of walking forward. After 10 steps of walking forward, you go back, you say, I'm in this new situation right here, what should I do? And again, the planner is going to be like, if you first walk forward and then walk back, where are you going to be, and so on. So the planner will always plan, basically to go from where you are, to the checkpoint, using a composition of the skills that you have learned. So the planner may be fine, okay, if I first walk forward, walk back a bit, and so on, I'm going to get to the goal, I'm going to reach the goal. Now please, agent execute this first thing, walk forward, the agent executes it, and maybe it won't, you know, it won't do as well, it will maybe end up here. And then it says, Well, I'm here now, please plan again. So it plans again, it says, Okay, I can still kind of walk back, I'll be here here, but then I have to do something else. So now walk back. And, okay, so this is what's going to happen. But it is going to happen in a weird way. Namely, what we keep our normal, since everything is continuous, we'll keep normal distributions of all our future steps. So we don't say, Okay, I go here, and then I go here. What you'll say is I approximately go here. And after that, I'll approximately go here. And you will do it in such a way that the peak of this normal distribution is going to be the highest, where you think you will get the most reward. If you follow this trajectory, like if you follow this trajectory, you get a very high reward. And if I follow a trajectory that maybe goes here, I won't get a high reward. If it actually turns out in your imagination that you do get a high reward for this trajectory, you'll change this distribution, such that the peak is here. And, of course, the tighter the peak is, the more sure you are. So you sort of are looking, if you look out into the world, you want the closest steps to be very peaky. And then as you look out, they can be more more sort of broad. And that's how you plan ahead, you keep\",\n",
              " \"Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills (Paper Explained): refining, you keep doing a step. So if you go from here to finally you choose, I want to go here where the tip is the highest over here, then you imagine forward again, you refine these distributions over the future. And then you take the next step that gets you to the where the highest peak is right here, basically, and so on. This is simply planning in a continuous domain, it is pretty analogous to how you would plan in like, alpha go, if you or tic tac toe if you had a planner, but since everything's continuous, it makes it just so much harder. So they Yeah, they always update these distributions, as you can see here, to the skill that gave you a high reward in your imagination compared to the rewards of the other plans that you had. Okay, well, this was a long, long way until we got here. But if you recap, so first, they in an unsupervised fashion, learn these low level skills such that they're easily predictable by their own world model, and diverse. And then in the second step, they can use that to to do basically planning. So they first learn these skills, and then the planner composes them to make the agent do something. And again, the agent will never have to learn how to do this go from checkpoint to checkpoint, because the planner can just compose these low level skills. So they have these experiments right here. And we won't go through the experiment because this video is already very, very long, but they basically show that they their learned things, actually, their learned skills do end up being very diverse do end up predictable, have a high variance, and so on, they have to give certain priors to it to make it actually work in a real setting. But the results you can actually see in these videos and in the graphs, I invite you to check out the paper if you're still here. Thanks for being here. I hope this this was one of the most more complicated and mathy papers we looked at. But I think I still think it's fun. And I still think the outcome is pretty impressive right here, how you can use math to derive basically these intuitive, very intuitive objectives to learn. It's also pretty cool. Alright, that was it for me. And bye bye.\"]"
